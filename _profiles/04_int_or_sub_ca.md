| **Field** |       |       | **Value**                             |
| :-------- | :---: | :---: | :-------------------------------     |
| Version   |       |       | V3 (2)                                 |
| Serial Number   |       |       | Must be a unique positive number. |
| Issuer Signature Algorithm   |       |       |  One of the following: <br>sha256 WithRSAEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 11} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA256 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.2} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA384 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.3} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA512 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.4}. | 
| Issuer Distinguished Name   |       |       |  Unique X.500 Issuing CA DN. <BR>For CAs operating under the Common Policy CP (i.e., _X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework_), must use one of the name forms specified in the Common Policy CP, Section 3.1.1. |
| Validity Period   |       |       |  No longer than 10 years from date of issue.<BR>expressed in UTCTime for dates until end of 2049 and GeneralizedTime for dates thereafter.  | 
| Subject   |       |       |   Unique X.500 Issuing CA DN.<BR>For CAs operating under the Common Policy CP, must use one of the name forms specified in the Common Policy CP, Section 3.1.1.<BR>Subject name should be encoded exactly as it is encoded in the issuer field of certificates issued by the subject.   |
| Subject Public Key Information   |       |       |   For RSA, must be at least 2048 bit modulus, rsaEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 1}.<BR>For ECC, implicitly specify parameters through an OID associated with a NIST-approved curve referenced in NIST SP 800-78-2.   |
| Signature   |       |       |   sha256 WithRSAEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 11}<BR>or ECDSA with appropriate Hash.   |
|               |                 |              |                                       |
| **Extension** |  **Required**   | **Critical** | **Value**                             |
| AuthorityKeyIdentifier  | Mandatory |  |  Octet string; typically derived using the SHA-1 hash of the signerâ€™s public key. |
| SubjectKeyIdentifier  | Mandatory |  |  Octet string; typically derived using the SHA-1 hash of the subject public key.<BR>This extension is required to assist in path development.<BR>The value in this field must be the same value that the subject CA uses in the authority key identifier extension of the certificates and CRLs that it signs with the private key that corresponds to the subject public key included in this certificate. |
| KeyUsage  | Mandatory | True |  keyCertSign, cRLSign, DigitalSignature (optional), nonRepudiation (optional). |
| BasicConstraints   | Mandatory | True |  cA=True; path length constraint is optional. |
| SubjectInfoAccess   | Mandatory |  |  id-ad-caRepository (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.5) access method entry containing at least one HTTP URL for .p7c file containing certificates issued by this CA.<BR>Certificates may also include a URI name form to specify an LDAP-accessible directory server.<BR>Each URI must point to a location where CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate may be found. <BR>SubjectInfoAccess may be omitted if the subject CA does not issue any CA certificates. |
| Certificate Policies   | Mandatory  |  | Application certificate policy identifiers. |
| cRLDistributionPoints   | Mandatory  |  | This extension must appear in all certificates and must include at least an HTTP URI distribution point name.<BR>Common and PIV-I prohibit the use of indirect CRLs or CRLs segmented by reason code. |
| authorityInfoAccess   | Mandatory  |  | authorityInfoAccess consists of a sequence of accessMethod and accessLocation pairs.<BR>id-ad-caIssuers {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2} access method entry containing HTTP URL for .p7c file containing certificates issued to this CA;<BR>LDAP URI may optionally be included.<BR>id-ad-ocsp {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1} access method entry contains HTTP URL for the Issuing CA OCSP Responder, if available.<BR>OCSP is mandatory for CAs issuing PIV, PIV-I, or TLS subscriber certificates. |
| policyConstraints   | Optional  |  | At least one of requireExplicitPolicy or inhibitPolicyMapping must be present.<BR>When present, this extension should be marked as noncritical, to support legacy applications that cannot process policyConstraints.<BR>InhibitPolicyMapping skipcerts = 0 for a CA certificate issued under the same CP as issuing CA, to not allow transitive trust. |
| inhibitAnyPolicy   | Optional  |  | SkipCerts=0. |
| nameConstraints   | Optional  | True | If present, any combination of permitted and excluded subtrees may appear.<BR>If permitted and excluded subtrees overlap, the excluded subtree takes precedence.<BR>It is recommended that name constraints only be imposed on the directoryName name form. |
| IssuerAltName   | Optional  |  | Any name types may be present; most common is rfc822Name for email of PKI administrator. |
| SubjectAltName   | Optional  |  | Any name types may be present; most common is rfc822Name for email of subject PKI administrator. |
